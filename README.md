## üìù Project Overview

The Personal Portfolio Website is a fully responsive and visually engaging web project designed to represent a developer‚Äôs professional identity. This website functions as an online resume and showcases technical skills, educational background, personal projects, and contact information in an organized and aesthetically pleasing format.

The portfolio is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, without any frontend frameworks or libraries, to demonstrate foundational frontend development skills. The layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and is styled using CSS Flexbox and custom properties. JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity and manage dynamic UI elements.

The homepage includes a personal introduction with a name and tagline, along with a navigation bar that enables smooth scrolling to other sections. The **About Me** section shares details such as education, background, interests, and goals. In the **Skills** section, various programming languages, tools, and technologies are displayed, often accompanied by icons or graphics.

In the **Projects** section, key personal and academic projects are presented, including the real-time chat app. Each project card links to a GitHub repository and includes a brief description of the tech stack used. The **Resume** section provides a downloadable PDF version of the resume for quick access by recruiters or visitors.

The **Contact** section includes email, phone number, and links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. All buttons and links are functional, ensuring a seamless navigation experience. The site is structured to be user-friendly and professional, following best practices in web accessibility and semantic HTML.

The project folder is organized into separate directories for styles, scripts, images, and assets. CSS and JS files are kept modular and clean. The `index.html` file serves as the entry point for the entire website.

Version control was handled through Git, and the project was pushed to GitHub. For deployment, **GitHub Pages** was used, allowing the site to be hosted and accessible via a public URL.

This website not only serves as a professional portfolio but also acts as a base for extending features in the future. It can be scaled with backend integration or enhanced with React, animations, or additional sections like blogs or testimonials.

Overall, the task demonstrates practical application of core frontend technologies, understanding of responsive design, user experience considerations, and the importance of digital self-presentation in the modern job market.
